Supporting many chains typically requires maintaining liquidity pools on each chain. This ties up idle capital, limiting how many chains traditional bridges can practically support.

Using an [intents](/home/fundamentals/core-concepts/intents)-based model removes the need for pre-deployed liquidity. Liquidity is provided on demand at the moment of execution. This allows support for a wide range of blockchains, without additional liquidity constraints.
