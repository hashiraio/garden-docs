To participate in Garden's governance, one must be an active [staker](/home/fundamentals/core-concepts/stakers). The number of governance votes you own is dependent on the staking multiplier, similar to staking rewards.

For example, if you staked 21,000 SEED for 24 months, then your total voting power is 30 votes.

## Proposal process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Temp check">
    Before raising a proposal at Garden, it is essential to initiate a [Temp Check](https://gov.garden.finance/). This preliminary step allows you to gauge community interest and determine whether there is sufficient support to alter the status quo.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Raise a proposal">
    After your proposal passes the temp check, you can create a formal proposal for community voting on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:gardenfinance.eth/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Community voting">
    The voting phase lasts for 7 days where stakers cast their votes via Snapshot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Once a proposal achieves quorum, the Garden core team works with the proposer to ensure effective implementation.

### Temp check

#### Engage with community

You can share your idea with the community and gather feedback by raising a **temp check** on https://gov.garden.finance/. This is the first step to understand perspectives and build alignment.

A temp check is considered **passed** once it receives **10 upvotes**.

Once that happens, the idea moves to the **Garden Improvement Proposal (GIP)** stage. At this stage, gardeners who have staked SEED will formally vote on the proposal via Snapshot.

### Raise a proposal

After your proposal passes the temp check, you can start creating a proposal. A formal proposal marks the transition from idea to action. Proposals have to be submitted for community voting on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gardenfinance.eth).

In your proposal, clearly state the problem you aim to address and describe the proposed solution in detail. Outline actionable steps required to implement this solution, providing links to any relevant code repositories or resources. Additionally, discuss the expected outcomes, detailing both the potential benefits and any risks.

<Warning>
  Raising a proposal requires a minimum of **500 votes**. Proposers are responsible for finding a community backer with enough votes to sponsor their proposal.
</Warning>

### Community voting

The voting phase lasts for **7 days**, where stakers cast their votes via snapshot. Proposers can use this time to actively engage with the community in the [Townhall](https://discord.gg/B7RczEFuJ5) to generate excitement and support for their proposal.

<Tip>
  Encourage discussions, answer questions, and highlight the benefits of the proposal to motivate community members to participate in the voting process.
</Tip>

### Implementation

Once a proposal achieves a **quorum of at least 6,000 votes**, it is officially passed. The Garden core team will then work with the proposer to ensure effective implementation. This process ensures alignment with Garden's strategic goals and community interests.
