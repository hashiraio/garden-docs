## Roles on snapshot

Garden's Snapshot system features two key roles:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Super admin">
    - Manages and oversees the Snapshot space.
    - Maintains the integrity of the governance process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Author">
    - Can create and submit proposals for voting.
    - Any staker with more than 500 votes is eligible to become an author.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Voting power

Voting power in Garden is determined by staking [multipliers](/home/fundamentals/core-concepts/stakers) and ownership of the Gardener Pass NFT. Stakers gain increased voting power based on their staking multiplier, which rewards long-term commitment to the protocol. Additionally, Gardener Pass NFT holders receive a fixed voting power of 70 votes.
