description: "Implement atomic swaps on Sui using Move contracts with object-based architecture and registry pattern"

## Contract architecture

Garden uses Hashed Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs) to implement atomic swap functionality on Sui. The contract leverages Sui's object model with a shared registry pattern for efficient order management:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="Initiate" icon="play" href="#initiate" />
  <Card title="Redeem" icon="check" href="#redeem" />
  <Card title="Refund" icon="rotate-left" href="#refund" />
  <Card title="Instant refund" icon="bolt" href="#instant-refund" />
</CardGroup>

## Core functions

### Initiate

The initiate function creates a new HTLC by locking coins in a shared registry. Sui provides two initiation methods:

#### Basic initiation

```move
public fun initiate<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    redeemer_pubk: vector<u8>,
    secret_hash: vector<u8>,
    amount: u64,
    timelock: u256,
    coins: Coin<CoinType>,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

#### Initiation on behalf

```move
public fun initiate_on_behalf<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    initiator: address,
    redeemer_pubk: vector<u8>,
    secret_hash: vector<u8>,
    amount: u64,
    timelock: u256,
    coins: Coin<CoinType>,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

<Note>
Sui uses Ed25519 public keys for redeemers instead of addresses, providing more flexibility in key management and enabling advanced signature schemes.
</Note>

### Redeem

The redeem function allows the redeemer to claim the locked tokens by providing the secret that hashes to the stored secret hash.

```move
public fun redeem_swap<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    secret: vector<u8>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

<Info>
The secret must hash to the exact value stored during initiation using SHA256. Once revealed, this secret enables the counterparty to claim funds on the other chain. No signature required - anyone can execute if they know the secret.
</Info>

### Refund

The refund function allows the initiator to reclaim their tokens after the timelock has expired and the redeemer has not claimed the funds.

```move
public fun refund_swap<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

<Note>
Uses absolute timestamps in milliseconds for timelock, providing more granular control compared to block-based systems.
</Note>

### Instant refund

The instant refund function provides a way for the redeemer to consent to canceling the swap before the timelock expires using Ed25519 signatures.

```move
public fun instant_refund<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    signature: vector<u8>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

<Note>
This requires the redeemer's Ed25519 signature to prevent unauthorized instant refunds. This ensures mutual consent before the settlement window expires.
</Note>

## Sui-specific features

### Order state management

The contract uses Move structs to store swap state with Sui's object model:

```move
public struct Order<phantom CoinType> has key, store {
    id: UID,
    is_fulfilled: bool,
    initiator: address,
    redeemer_pubk: vector<u8>,
    amount: u64,
    initiated_at: u256,
    coins: Coin<CoinType>,
    timelock: u256,
}
```

### Registry pattern

Sui's shared object model enables efficient order management through a registry:

```move
public struct OrdersRegistry<phantom CoinType> has key, store {
    id: UID,
}
```

<Note>
The registry uses dynamic fields to store orders, allowing unlimited scalability while maintaining efficient access patterns.
</Note>

### Token handling

**Native Coin objects:**
- Orders store coins directly as `Coin<CoinType>` objects.
- Built-in safety guarantees prevent accidental coin loss.
- Uses `transfer::public_transfer` for secure transfers.
- No manual balance tracking required.

<Tip>
Sui's Coin objects provide superior safety compared to manual balance management, as coins cannot be accidentally lost or duplicated due to Move's resource type system.
</Tip>

### Address generation

Sui generates addresses from Ed25519 public keys using a specific scheme:

```move
fun gen_addr(pubk: vector<u8>): address {
    // 0x00 = ED25519, 0x01 = Secp256k1, 0x02 = Secp256r1, 0x03 = multiSig
    let flag: u8 = 0;
    let mut preimage = vector::empty<u8>();
    vector::push_back(&mut preimage, flag);
    vector::append(&mut preimage, pubk);
    let addr = blake2b256(&preimage);
    address::from_bytes(addr)
}
```

### Event logging

The contract emits events for each state transition to enable efficient off-chain monitoring:

```move
public struct Initiated has copy, drop {
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    secret_hash: vector<u8>,
    amount: u64,
}

public struct Redeemed has copy, drop {
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    secret_hash: vector<u8>,
    secret: vector<u8>,
}

public struct Refunded has copy, drop {
    order_id: vector<u8>,
}
```

### Order ID generation

Unique order identifiers are generated using SHA256 hashing with chain-specific parameters:

```move
fun create_order_id(
    secret_hash: vector<u8>,
    initiator: address,
    redeemer: address,
    timelock: u256,
    amount: u64,
): vector<u8>
```

<Check>
Chain ID inclusion prevents cross-chain replay attacks, while the parameter combination ensures each order is uniquely identifiable across the network.
