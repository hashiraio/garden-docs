## Contract architecture

Garden uses Hashed Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs) to implement atomic swap functionality on Solana. The program manages the lifecycle of a swap through four main operations using Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for state management:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="Initiate" icon="play" href="#initiate" />
  <Card title="Redeem" icon="check" href="#redeem" />
  <Card title="Refund" icon="rotate-left" href="#refund" />
  <Card title="Instant Refund" icon="bolt" href="#instant-refund" />
</CardGroup>

## Core functions

### Initiate

The initiate function creates a new HTLC by transferring SOL to a PDA vault. It requires:

- Secret hash: SHA256 hash of a preimage known only to the initiator.
- Timelock: Number of slots after which refund is possible (1 slot ≈ 400ms).
- Redeemer: Public key authorized to claim the funds.
- Amount: Quantity of native SOL in lamports (1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports).

```rust
pub fn initiate(
    ctx: Context<Initiate>,
    amount_lamports: u64,
    expires_in_slots: u64,
    redeemer: Pubkey,
    secret_hash: [u8; 32],
) -> Result<()>
```

<Note>
Uses PDAs as deterministic vaults, ensuring each swap with the same initiator and secret hash is unique and prevents replay attacks.
</Note>

### Redeem

The redeem function allows the redeemer to claim the locked SOL by providing the secret that hashes to the stored secret hash.

```rust
pub fn redeem(
    ctx: Context<Redeem>, 
    secret: [u8; 32]
) -> Result<()>
```

<Info>
The secret must hash to the exact value stored during initiation. Once revealed, this secret enables the counterparty to claim funds on the other chain. No signature required — anyone can execute if they know the secret.
</Info>

### Refund

The refund function allows the initiator to reclaim their SOL after the timelock has expired and the redeemer has not claimed the funds.

```rust
pub fn refund(ctx: Context<Refund>) -> Result<()>
```

<Note>
Uses slot-based timing which provides more granular control than Bitcoin's block-based system. Each slot represents approximately 400ms.
</Note>

### Instant refund

The instant refund function provides a way for the redeemer to consent to canceling the swap before the timelock expires.

```rust
pub fn instant_refund(ctx: Context<InstantRefund>) -> Result<()>
```

<Warning>
Requires the redeemer's signature to prevent unauthorized instant refunds. This ensures mutual consent before the settlement window expires.
</Warning>

## Solana-specific features

### PDA state management

The program uses a PDA (Program Derived Address) to store swap state, derived from deterministic seeds:

```rust
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct SwapAccount {
    amount_lamports: u64,    // SOL amount in base units
    expiry_slot: u64,        // Absolute slot for expiry
    initiator: Pubkey,       // Initiator's public key
    redeemer: Pubkey,        // Redeemer's public key  
    secret_hash: [u8; 32],   // SHA256 hash of secret
}
```

### Account constraints

Anchor provides compile-time account validation and runtime constraints:

```rust
#[account(
    init,
    payer = initiator,
    seeds = [b"swap_account", initiator.key().as_ref(), &secret_hash],
    bump,
    space = ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR + SwapAccount::INIT_SPACE,
)]
pub swap_account: Account<'info, SwapAccount>,
```

<Tip>
The seed structure ensures that each swap is uniquely identified by the initiator and secret hash, preventing duplicate swaps until completion.
</Tip>

### Event logging

The program emits events for each state transition to enable efficient off-chain monitoring:

```rust
#[event]
pub struct Initiated {
    pub swap_amount: u64,
    pub expires_in_slots: u64,
    pub initiator: Pubkey,
    pub redeemer: Pubkey,
    pub secret_hash: [u8; 32],
}

#[event]
pub struct Redeemed {
    pub initiator: Pubkey,
    pub secret: [u8; 32],
}
```

### Rent management

Solana's rent system is automatically handled through Anchor's `close` attribute:

```rust
#[account(mut, close = initiator)]
pub swap_account: Account<'info, SwapAccount>,
```

<Check>
When a swap completes (redeem/refund), the PDA is closed and rent is automatically refunded to the initiator, ensuring no SOL is permanently locked.
</Check>

### Error handling

Custom error types provide clear feedback for failed operations:

```rust
#[error_code]
pub enum SwapError {
    #[msg("The provided initiator is not the original initiator of this swap")]
    InvalidInitiator,
    #[msg("The provided redeemer is not the original redeemer of this swap")]  
    InvalidRedeemer,
    #[msg("The provided secret does not correspond to the secret hash of this swap")]
    InvalidSecret,
    #[msg("Attempt to perform a refund before expiry time")]
    RefundBeforeExpiry,
}
```
